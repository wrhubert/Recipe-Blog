This is one of my earlier projects involving EJS/Express libraries for Node.js.  The main purpose of the exercise was for me to practice and demonstate my abilities using Backend JS 
to create a Recipe Blog.  There are no databases or other permanent storage as the primary goal above was to get used to using Node and the libraries.  The recipes are stored as objects within 
an array and there is one already coded in as an example.  The user may create as many recipes as they wish on the 'Create' page by entering in the information and clicking 'Submit'.  

Note: Future modifications will include both edit and delete recipe options.
